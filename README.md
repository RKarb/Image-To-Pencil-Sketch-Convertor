# Image-To-Pencil-Sketch-Convertor

A basic program which converts selected images to 'sketches'. This is done via taking negatives as well as blurs and meshing them together.
Upon running the program a dialog box opens informing the user of the function. 'Cancel' can be pressed to end the program, otherwise if 'Ok' 
is pressed the File Explorer opens and allows for an image to be selected.
